      <description>We recently hit an issue with a system at work which manually linked against the CUDA driver API at runtime. One function used to retrieve the memory limit of the GPU was always returning a 32 bit value even if the card had &amp;gt;4GB of VRAM and we were passing a 64 bit integer. On further investigation through forums we discovered the function originally took a 32bit integer and there was a newer version with the same name.</description>
